# Qiskit-Course

This repository was made for the course Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware offered by IBM that you can find [here](https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/).
Here I am sharing my answers and points of view about the problems presented in the course and giving my solutions to them.

The course consist in a series of 9 lectures of approximately  2 hours each divided in different videos trating the following topics.

## 1. Introduction to Quantum Computing:
### 1.1 From bits to Qubits:
This section introduces the notion of qubit. Besides that gives us the Dirac notation, explanning what is a ket and a bra and showing us how these can be seen as vectors. Then gives us the notion of measurement as the probability of a supperposed state to collapsed into one of the states that correspond to the basis in which we are meaking the measurement. Finally it is shown how all normalized and pure quantum states can be illustrated on the surface of a sphere with radious $|\vec(r)|=1$ called the Bloch Sphere.
